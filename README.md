# Customer Conversion Analysis for Online Shopping Using Clickstream Data

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior using **Clickstream Data** to predict purchasing decisions, estimate potential revenue, and segment customers. It applies various **Supervised** and **Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques** to provide actionable insights for online retailers.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**: For data preprocessing
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Scikit-Learn**: For Machine Learning models
- **Streamlit**: For building an interactive application
- **Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Decision Tree**: For regression and classification
- **K-Means Clustering**: For customer segmentation

---

## 🔎 Problem Statements
1. **Classification Problem:** Predict whether a customer will complete a purchase (`1`) or not (`2`) based on browsing behavior using **Random Forest** and **Decision Tree** models with 90% accuracy.
2. **Regression Problem:** Estimate the potential revenue a customer is likely to generate using **Gradient Boosting** with 90% accuracy.
3. **Clustering Problem:** Segment customers into distinct groups using **K-Means Clustering** based on their online behavior patterns.
