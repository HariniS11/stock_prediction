# stock_prediction
## Stock prediction project going to predict Close price of stock using given input variable under supervised learning.
## In this project before prediction have done some steps:
## Data Preprocessing
### 1. Data cleaning 
### 2. Imputation
### 3. Outlier check
### 4. Skwewness detection
### 5. Visualization of data distribution using bar chart, scatter plot etc...
### 6. Encoding Techniques
### 7. Scaling of data
### 8. Feature elimination
### 9. Correlation technique like MANOVA , CORREALTION MATRIX....

## Model Training
### Algorithms: Linear regression , Decision tree regressor. Training the model (splitting data sets as train and test) , Testing the model , Evaluation of model.
