Clickstream - Customer Conversion Prediction
Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing customer browsing behavior using clickstream data to predict purchasing tendencies and optimize business strategies. The project tackles three core machine learning problems:

Classification: Predict whether a customer will complete a purchase (1) or not (2).

Regression: Estimate potential revenue per customer to enhance business revenue forecasting.

Clustering: Segment customers based on behavior for personalized marketing and recommendations.

By leveraging machine learning techniques, businesses can enhance user experience, improve marketing strategies, and increase conversion rates.

Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy (Data Preprocessing)

Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Models)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Streamlit (Interactive User Interface)

Approach & Methodology
Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Processed raw clickstream data to extract key features like session duration, number of page views, product interactions, etc.

Handled missing values and outliers to improve data quality.

Feature Engineering:

Created new features from clickstream logs to improve model accuracy.

Encoded categorical features and scaled numerical values.

Modeling & Evaluation:

Classification Models: Decision Trees, Random Forest

Decision Trees (after pruning): 97% accuracy

Random Forest: 91% accuracy

Regression Model: Trained to estimate customer revenue.

Clustering Model: Used k-means to segment customers into behavioral groups.

Streamlit Application:

Interactive UI for users to input customer browsing data and get predictions.

Displays customer segmentation insights and revenue estimations.
